# This is a report for the API project
* First i started with the design of my data model and that basically dictated my endpoint design, i did add the error class quite late in the project and that caused bit of problems where i had to erase all of my data basically.
* I broke down the endpoints into 3 categories, blocks, probes and measurements. I probably could have created one more for errors but it felt uneccessary. I wanted to start with basics and create the  "create" and "delete" endpoints first, tested my data and made necessary changes. I should have started with more design first kind of approach but i feel like managed well. 
* I mainly used only 3 different HTTP codes, 200 for OK which is the default, 404 for not found and 400 to signal some sort of user/frontend error. For the http methods i used the usual GET for just asking for data, PUT for editing,DELETE for deleting obviously and POST for creating. Had a pretty big focus on error handling and avoiding breaking the app.
* I learned alot about API design and managing errors in this project, also first time actually using a database like this and designing my own data model was actually alot of fun, overall this project was alot of fun even if it was quite intensive to make.
